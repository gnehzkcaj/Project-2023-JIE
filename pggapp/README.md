## Description
- This project is my Final Project for the General Assembly React Course.
- This project is a web application built with React and Material UI that provides a seamless and dynamic user experience through client-side routing using React Router. This project aims to demonstrate how to implement navigation and routing functionalities in a single-page application, making it easy to create multi-page-like experiences without full page reloads.

### Project Requirement
- This is an open-ended project. We can't provide any set solution, but we're always here to help. You'll be making your own React app. This can be a website you imagine, but feel free to pick an existing website and try to mimic it.
- Your app must utilize nested components and state.
- Your app must use React Router and have multiple in-app pages.
- Your app must make use of an API - either a public API or one you build yourself
- A list of some more APIs for inspiration: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

### My Solution
- A mimic website of www.pokemon.com using [pokeapi](pokeapi.co)

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project. Include any dependencies that need to be installed and any configuration required.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gnehzkcaj/Project-2023-JIE.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd pggapp`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application. You can navigate through different views by clicking on the provided links or by directly entering specific URLs in the browser.

Feel free to explore the different features implemented in the application, such as nested routes, route parameters, and the 404 page.

## Features

- **Client-Side Routing:** Utilizes React Router to manage client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different views without refreshing the entire page.
- **Multiple Routes:** Configured with multiple routes, each associated with a unique URL, allowing users to access specific content through URLs directly.
- **Nested Routes:** Implements nested routes to create a hierarchical structure for components, offering flexibility and organization in building complex UI layouts.
- **Route Parameters:** Demonstrates how to use route parameters to handle dynamic content, enabling components to display data based on URL parameters.
- **404 Page:** Implements a custom 404 page for handling undefined routes, providing users with a user-friendly error page when navigating to non-existent routes.
